Kaggle Titanic Dataset - 1st attempt

Working with this dataset was part of a set of exercises for a book I'm working through, so that's why the "HOML..." file name.

This dataset shows loading, processing pipeline, Random Forest Classifier, and output.
I ended up with a little over 74% accuracy, and my own suggestions for improvement are in the notebook.
